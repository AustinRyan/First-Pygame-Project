# First-Pygame-Project
This is my first time using pygame, as I am trying to become more experienced with python. 
I followed Tech with Tims video on pygame for beginners to help me create this. 
There are two spaceships, each spaceship gets 10 health, and when you are shot by a bullet your health will go down by one.
First person to reach 0 health loses.
Controls: WASD(left, right up down) for left spaceship, and for the right spaceship to move use the arrow keys.
How to fire: Left spaceship use the left control key and right spaceship use the right shift key.
